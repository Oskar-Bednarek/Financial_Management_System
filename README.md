## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oskar-Bednarek/Financial_Management_System.git
cd Financial_Management_System
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This includes:
- Flask and SQLAlchemy for the web framework
- PostgreSQL drivers (psycopg2)
- Google API clients for Drive/Sheets integration
- Anthropic SDK for Claude AI
- pandas, openpyxl for data export
- And many more scientific computing libraries

---

### ✅ Step 4: Configure the database

Copy the example configuration file and edit it:

```bash
cp config_example.py config.py
```

Then open `config.py` and set your:

- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` - Your PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., Neon, local PostgreSQL)
- `SECRET_KEY` - Any random string for Flask session security

Example:
```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"
SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key-here"
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Set up environment variables (for workflows)

Create a `.env` file in the project root for sensitive credentials:

```bash
# Google OAuth2 Credentials (for workflow automation)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token

# Anthropic API (for Claude AI)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Optional: Other API keys
CONVERTAPI_SECRET=your-convertapi-secret
```

**Note**: Workflow features require these credentials. Core financial features work without them.

**How to get Google OAuth credentials**:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a project and enable Drive + Sheets APIs
3. Create OAuth2 credentials
4. Use the OAuth playground to get a refresh token

---

### ✅ Step 6: Add your logos

Add 2 logo files to these paths:

- `app/static/logo.png` - Main logo visible in the sidebar
- `app/static/logo2.png` - Logo used for document watermarks

You may use the placeholders already included if you just want to test.

---

### ✅ Step 7: Run the application

```bash
python run.py
```



The application auto-opens your browser after a 1.5-second delay.

---

## 🧊 Building a Windows Executable (Optional)

To generate a single `.exe` for end users (no Python required):

1. Install PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Build the executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --add-data "app;app" --add-data "tailwind.config.js;." run.py
```

3. The `.exe` will appear in the `dist/` folder.

You can distribute this to others without requiring Python or manual setup.

## 🎯 Key Modules Explained

### `app/functions.py` - Centralized Business Logic
This module contains all reusable business logic extracted from routes:

- **Financial calculations**: Interest computation, capitalization, repayment allocation
- **Data validation**: Date parsing, decimal handling, checkbox parsing
- **Polish formatting**: `format_number_pl()` for currency display
- **Database queries**: Filtered queries with sorting and pagination
- **CRUD operations**: Project, loan, tranche, repayment, adjustment management

### `app/routes/workflows.py` - AI Automation
Handles the automated tenant change protocol workflow:

1. Receives form input (project name, unit number, contract date, Excel file)
2. Looks up project data from master Google Sheet
3. Uploads Excel file to Google Drive and converts to Sheets
4. Calls Claude AI API to analyze price estimate
5. Creates and fills protocol template in Google Sheets
6. Exports both protocol and estimate to PDF
7. Organizes all files in Drive folders

### `app/workflows/workflow_nodes.py` - Google Integration
Helper functions for Google services:

- `get_google_credentials()` - OAuth2 authentication
- `get_google_services()` - Returns authenticated Drive/Sheets clients
- `create_drive_folder()` - Creates folders in Drive
- `upload_excel_to_drive()` - Uploads files
- `convert_excel_to_google_sheet()` - Converts Excel to Sheets format

---

## 🔧 Database Models

The system uses 5 core SQLAlchemy models:

1. **Project** - Main entity tracking project lifecycle
   - Fields: ProjectID, ProjectName, Status, StartDate, EndDate
   - Status: "In Progress", "On Hold", "Completed", "Cancelled"

2. **Loan** - Individual loans linked to projects
   - Fields: LoanID, ProjectID, InterestRate, TaxRate, Capitalization
   - Supports multiple loans per project

3. **Tranche** - Loan disbursements
   - Fields: TrancheID, LoanID, Amount, TrancheDate
   - Tracks when and how much was disbursed

4. **Repayment** - Payments against tranches
   - Fields: RepaymentID, TrancheID, Amount, RepaymentDate
   - Automatically allocated to reduce principal

5. **Adjustment** - Manual corrections
   - Fields: AdjustmentID, TrancheID, Amount, AdjustmentDate, Description
   - Allows manual interest/principal adjustments

## 🤖 AI Workflow Details

The workflow automation uses Claude 3.5 Haiku to intelligently analyze price estimates:

**Input**: Excel file with cost breakdown
**AI Processing**:
- Analyzes all sheets for cost data
- Extracts total cost (removes spaces: `4 600,20` → `4600,20`)
- Summarizes changes in max 5 bullet points (60 chars each)
- Groups related changes (e.g., "Wentylacja, ogrodzenie, sufity")
- Removes brand names, uses generic categories

**Output**: JSON with `total_cost`, `summary_points`, `sheet_name`

**Protocol Generation**:
- Fills template with project data, AI summary, costs
- Calculates adjusted price based on unit area (150m² threshold)
- Generates price difference formula
- Exports to PDF with proper Polish formatting

---
